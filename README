This is a fork of the original vzaar gem. It has been further tweaked (and better documented) to work with rails 3.1 on one of our own personal projects.
The rails generator from the original gem doesn't work anymore, but everything else seems to work fine.

== Rails 3.1 ==

Puts this on your Gemfile:

  gem 'vzaar', git: 'http://github.com/tailorbirds/vzaar.git'
  gem 'oauth', '0.3.6'
  gem 'httpclient'
  
Next, copy the following folders (since the generator is broken):
  * {vzaar-folder}/rails_generators/templates/images/* into {rails_root}/app/assets/images
  * {vzaar-folder}/rails_generators/templates/javascripts into {rails_root}/app/assets/javascripts/vzaar
  * {vzaar-folder}/rails_generators/templates/stylesheets into {rails_root}/app/assets/stylesheets/vzaar
  * {vzaar-folder}/rails_generators/templates/flash into {rails_root}/public/flash/vzaar
  * {vzaar-folder}/rails_generators/templates/views/uploader.html.erb into {rails_root}/app/views/vzaar/index.html.erb
  * {vzaar-folder}/lib/rails/controllers/vzaar_controller.rb into {rails_root}/app/controllers/vzaar_controller.rb
  
If you don't know where the gem was installed (by bundler), you can find it with 'bundle show vzaar'

You will need to configure your username and application secret in VzaarController.connect_to_vzaar accordinly, and also add the following routes to config/routes.rb:
  match "/vzaar" => "vzaar#index"
  match "/vzaar/signature" => "vzaar#signature"
  match "/vzaar/process_video" => "vzaar#process_video"
  
After that, you should be able to access vzaar/index and see your uploaded videos and upload new ones to vzaar.

== TODO ==
* Make generator work
* Add specs
* Make the default uploader better
